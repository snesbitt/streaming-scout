# Streaming Profile

**Last updated:** 2026-07-21

## Services Tracked
- Netflix — active
- Prime Video — active

## Premium/Channel Add-ons (tracked for Coming Soon schedules, not watch-history sync)
- BritBox (via Prime Video channel)
- PBS Masterpiece (via Prime Video channel)

## Off-Platform Viewing (reported in chat, not syncable)
- Nat Geo — Tucci in Italy S1–S2, in progress (Susan, 2026-07-25). No account
  page to sync; log via the log-watched skill when she reports progress.

## Other-Services Recommendations Policy (Susan, 2026-07-25)
High-match titles on services beyond the tracked four may appear in Top Picks,
clearly badged with their service (e.g. MGM+). This widens the pool; it does
not add those services to sync.

## Sync Cadence
Weekly (Monday, via the `streaming-scout-weekly-resync` scheduled task)

## Notes
Bootstrapped 2026-07-21 after the prior profile was found to be unrecoverable — it had
been written to a Cowork session's own ephemeral output folder (`workspace root`, per the
`streaming-setup` skill) instead of a stable location, and that session is gone. Service
list and cadence above are reconstructed from `/Users/snesbitt/Projects/streaming-scout/CLAUDE.md`
and `README.md`, which describe the product as ranking picks from Susan's real Netflix and
Prime Video history plus BritBox and PBS Masterpiece — not guessed. See
`STREAMING_LOG.md` and `EXCLUDED_TITLES.md` in this same folder for what could and
couldn't be recovered.

This file (and the rest of `data/`) now lives inside the git repo specifically so this
can't happen again — see CLAUDE.md's "Where the persistent data actually lives" section.
